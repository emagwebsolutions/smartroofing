          text="Steptile Aluminium roof sheets are incredibly popular amongst roofers and contractors, and there are several good reasons why you should choose aluminium for your next project. Not only is it a versatile material that will be well-suited and structurally sound on a range of agricultural and outbuildings, itâ€™s easy to work with too so it can be used for DIY roofing projects. Garden studios, workshops and even home offices can benefit from being topped with metal roof sheets instead of other traditional roofing materials as they can be less expensive overall and easier to install for a beginner DIYer."
