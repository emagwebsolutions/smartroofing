            <h3>HOW LONG WILL A NEW ROOF LAST?</h3>
            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The lifespan of a roof depends on so many factors that include
                  exposure to natural elements such as rain, wind, sun, humidity
                  and snow. The conditions will in time age the roofing
                  components if you have few roofs that are missing or damaged
                </li>

                <li>
                  Gutters that do not drain properly pose major problems to the
                  roofing components. These clogged gutters allow rain water to
                  flow back onto the roof possibly rotting the decking and the
                  fascia boards
                </li>

                <li>
                  Inadequate roof ventilation and insulation can also reduce the
                  lifespan of the roofing components. Without sufficient space
                  ventilation, extreme temperature difference between the space
                  of the home and the outdoors will cause an expansion and
                  contraction of the roofing components which may rub granules
                  off the shingle and cause shingle to curl.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Depending on the selection of roofing components, new roofs
                  are given years of warranty regarding the roof in question.
                  The material types include: AZ150 – 30 years warranty Premium
                  Aluzinc – 15 years warranty Stone-coated Chipped Tiles – 50
                  years warranty Steel Trusses – 60 years warranty Aluminum
                  (IBR, IDT, Standing Seam) – Lifetime.

                  Firstly, you need to get ladder in place to enable the
                  installer to climb with ease but if Westcoast Roofing System
                  is install either the wood or the trusses, we will be
                  responsible for providing the ladder.
                </li>
                <li>
                  During installation, there will be vibrations so it is
                  recommended that ceiling fixtures are protected and all
                  pictures and items of value are removed from the walls. If you
                  need any assistance, please be sure to ask us before the
                  project begins.

                  Leakages are obvious clues that your roof needs repair or
                  replacement. The condition of the roof will determine whether
